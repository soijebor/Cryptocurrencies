The company, however, is lost in the immense universe of cryptocurrencies and asks me to present a report of what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how cryptocurrencies could be grouped toward creating a classification for developing this new investment product.

  * Prepare the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means.
  * Reduce data dimensions using PCA algorithms from sklearn.
  * Predict clusters using cryptocurrencies data using the K-means algorithm form sklearn.
  * Create some plots and data tables to present your results.
